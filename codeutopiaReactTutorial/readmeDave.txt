Nice tutorial for getting started with React, Browserify, Node/npm, Babel etc. 
One of the main features is example of node/CommonJS modules rather than ES6 import/export.  

https://codeutopia.net/blog/2016/01/25/getting-started-with-npm-and-browserify-in-a-react-project/

The example code in article1,3,4 and in react-chat-app use older 'createReactClass() method,
which needs the 'create-react-class' module installed for each project.

I re-wrote article2 to use the new 'class MyClass extends React.Component' approach so 
have removed that dependency from that app. 
To get started, take a look at article1 and article2.
